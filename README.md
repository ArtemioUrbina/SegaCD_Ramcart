# SegaCD_Ramcart
 Sega Genesis/Megadrive CD Back-up RAM Cart

 Design done in Kicad 5.1.10 with Digikey libraries. If you want to edit it, you'll need those libraries as well as these files.

 Board tested working 9/3/21 after fixing A20/A22 accidental swap @ U4.

 PCB revision 1.1 has this fixed (Current).

 RAM Cart tested 9/3 with Dark Wizard and does not have the save corruption issue that the Castlemania Ultra cart has.
